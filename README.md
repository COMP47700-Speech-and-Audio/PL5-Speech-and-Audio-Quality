## Learning Outcomes
* Analyse speech and audio signals and feature
* Create programmes to conduct experiments on speech and audio samples building on third software libraries

## Module Topics
Advanced topics Speech and Audio Quality

*   Speech and Audio Quality
*   Objective models of intelligibility and quality

## Why is it important?
* Data analysis and visualisation of advanced audio applications
* Using audio algorithms standardised by software and telecommunications industry e.g., [POLQA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_Objective_Listening_Quality_Analysis)
* Understanding perceptual audio concepts: mean opinion score
* Reflecting on mathematical tools used to measure audio quality e.g., signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), mean squared error (MSE)

## Structure of this tutorial
This practical tutorial contains different sections:
* **Live coding:** Basic theory, demos and coding examples presented by the lecturer on site (unmarked)
* **Student activity:** Familiarisation and coding exercises to be completed by the students and followed by a short discussion on site (unmarked). These activities introduce key concepts and skills necessary to complete the assignments.
* **Assignment:** Two (2) take home problem/coding questions to be completed by the students.
